I personally believe that while using pointers and pointer arithmetic may be more efficient, it's more reliable to use subscripting.
With pointers, you can easily go outside of the bounds of the array by accident and manipulate memory that you are not intending to.
This can lead to core dumping if you are not careful. For subscripting, you will get an error if you go outside of the bounds of the 
array. I also think that subscripting is more simple and easier to understand so there is a less likely chance of making coding 
errors.
