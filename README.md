1- Write three functions in C++ : one that declares a large array statistically, one
that declares the same large array on the stack, and one that creates the same
large array from the heap . Call each of the subprograms a large number of times
(at least 100000) and output the time required by each .


2- Write test programs in Java to determine the scope of a variable declared in a
for statement. Specifically, the code must determine whether such a variable is
visible after the body of the for statement


3- Write a Python program that has subprograms nested three deep and in which
each nested subprogram references local variables, variables defined in all of its
enclosing subprograms, and global variables.


4- Design a set of simple test programs to determine the type compatibility rules
of a java compiler to which you have access. Write a report (7-15 lines)


5- Write a simple program in C++ to investigate the safety of its enumeration
types. Include at least 10 different operations on enumeration types to determine
what incorrect or just silly things are legal


6- Write a C++ program that does a large number of references to elements of
two-dimensioned arrays, using only subscripting. Write a second program that
does the same operations but uses pointers and pointer arithmetic for the storage-mapping function to do the array references.. Which of the two programs is
likely to be more reliable? Why? (3- 6 lines)


7- Write a Java program that exposes Java’s rule for operand evaluation order
when one of the operands is a method call. Write a report (5 to 10 lines)


8- Answer the following Python Interview questions
• How is Python an interpreted language?
• What is the difference between Python Arrays, lists, tuples, and records? Explain it with examples
• What does [::-1} do? Explain it with an example
• How can you randomize the items of a list in place in Python?
• What is the difference between range & xrange?Explain it with an example
• What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python lists?
• How to add values to a python array? Explain it with an example
• What is split used for? Explain it with an example
