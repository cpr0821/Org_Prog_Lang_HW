To test the type compatibility rules in Java, I created variables of type int, String, float, double and char and tried to assign 
them to each other. For example, I tried to assign the float to the double, String, int, and char. I did this for every data type.
My conclusions are below:
1. A character can be implicitly converted to an integer, float and double (the ASCII value is used) but not a String.
2. Trying to assign a String, float or double to an integer variable results in an error.
3. Trying to assign an integer, float, double or char to a String variable results in an error.
4. If an integer or char is assigned to a float or a double then the resulting float is the integer with a ".0" at the end. For 
example, 1 became 1.0.
5. A double cannot be assigned to a float unless it is type-cast.
6. A String cannot be assigned to a float or a double.
7. A float can be assigned to a double.
8. Trying to assign an int, String, float or double to a char results in an error.
